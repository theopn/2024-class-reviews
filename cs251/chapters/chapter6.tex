\textit{Graph} is a set of vertices $V$ and a collection of edges $E$ that connect a pair of vertices. \textit{Undirected graph} is a graph where edges do not have direction. \textit{Degree of a vertex} representing how many edges is this vertex connected to.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Handshaking Theorem}: For any undirected graphs, \(\sum_{v \text{ in } V} deg(v) = 2 \cdot |E|\)
  \item Maximum degree of a vertex: $deg(v) \leq |V| - 1$, because a vertex cane be connected to all other vertices at most
  \item Maximum edge count: $|E| \leq \frac{|V|(|V| - 1)}{2}$
  \item \textbf{\textit{Complete graph}}: A graph is said to be complete when each vertex pair is connected by a unique edge. Id est, a complete graph has the maximum number of edges ($|E| = \frac{|V|(|V| - 1)}{2}$) and each vertex has the maximum degree ($deg(v) = |V| - 1$)
\end{itemize}
