# Sophomore Class Reviews

## CS251: Data Structures & Algorithms

DSA review, with a focuse on the graph theory.

Contents from Purdue CS251 course (Fall 2022, taught by Prof. Bejarano) and Introduction to Algorithms Third Edition (CLRS).

All example codes are written in Python and displayed using the `minted` package, I try to stick to the CLRS pseudocode as close as possible.
Full code can be found in the `/cs251/chapters/code/` directory.
